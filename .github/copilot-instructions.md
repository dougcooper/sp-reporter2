# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Date Range Reporter Plugin

## Project Overview

This is a plugin for [Super Productivity](https://super-productivity.com) that generates reports of completed tasks and tasks with work logs within a specified date range. The plugin is built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and integrates with Super Productivity's plugin API.

## Repository Structure

- `date-range-reporter/` - Main plugin files
  - `index.html` - Main UI with embedded JavaScript and CSS
  - `plugin.js` - Plugin registration and header button
  - `manifest.json.template` - Plugin metadata template
  - `icon.svg` - Plugin icon
- `tests/` - Vitest unit tests using JSDOM
- `Makefile` - Build and release automation
- `package.json` - Project dependencies and scripts

## Code Style and Standards

### JavaScript
- Use vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks) for plugin code
- Use modern ES6+ features (arrow functions, const/let, template literals)
- Follow camelCase naming convention for variables and functions
- Use descriptive function and variable names
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Avoid global pollution - scope variables appropriately

### HTML/CSS
- All plugin code is embedded in `date-range-reporter/index.html`
- Use CSS custom properties (variables) for theming
- Support both light and dark themes via `.dark-theme` body class
- Use semantic HTML elements where possible
- Keep CSS organized by section with clear comments

### Comments
- Add comments for complex logic or non-obvious behavior
- Document functions with clear parameter and return descriptions
- Include examples in comments where helpful
- Don't over-comment obvious code

## Testing Requirements

### Test Framework
- Use Vitest for all tests
- Tests use JSDOM to load and test the actual HTML file
- Mock the PluginAPI for integration tests

### Test Coverage
- Write unit tests for all new features
- Test both success and error scenarios
- Include edge cases (empty results, invalid dates, etc.)
- Mock external dependencies (PluginAPI, clipboard, etc.)
- Maintain existing test structure and patterns

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test                 # Run tests once
npm run test:watch       # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage    # Generate coverage report
make test                # Alternative using Makefile
```

## Plugin API Integration

### PluginAPI Methods
- `PluginAPI.getTasks()` - Get active tasks
- `PluginAPI.getArchivedTasks()` - Get archived tasks
- `PluginAPI.getAllProjects()` - Get project information
- `PluginAPI.showSnack()` - Show notifications
- `PluginAPI.getStorage()` - Get persistent storage
- `PluginAPI.setStorage()` - Save persistent data

### Error Handling
- Always wrap PluginAPI calls in try-catch blocks
- Show user-friendly error messages via `showSnack`
- Log detailed errors to console for debugging
- Gracefully degrade when API calls fail

## Build and Release Process

### Building
```bash
make build               # Build plugin zip file
make clean               # Clean generated files
make help                # Show available commands
```

### Release Process
1. Update version in `package.json`
2. Run `make release-check` to verify prerequisites
3. Run `make release` to:
   - Generate manifest.json from template
   - Create plugin zip file
   - Create and push git tag
   - Create GitHub release
4. Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)

### Prerequisites for Releases
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- Clean working directory (no uncommitted changes)
- Write access to repository

## Report Generation Guidelines

### Date Handling
- Use consistent date formatting: `YYYY-MM-DD` for storage
- Display dates in human-readable format: "Monday, January 15, 2024"
- Handle timezone considerations appropriately
- Validate date ranges (start must be <= end)

### Report Formatting
- Generate Markdown format for easy copy/paste
- Support two grouping modes: by Date and by Project
- Include time spent in human-readable format (e.g., "2h", "45m")
- Mark incomplete tasks with "WIP" indicator
- Show project names in brackets when applicable
- Include optional task notes when enabled

### Performance
- Filter tasks efficiently to avoid processing unnecessary data
- Use Sets to track processed tasks and avoid duplicates
- Minimize DOM manipulations
- Batch updates when possible

## UI/UX Guidelines

### Theme Support
- Detect theme from body class: `body.dark-theme`
- Use CSS custom properties for all colors
- Ensure good contrast in both light and dark themes
- Test all UI states in both themes

### User Feedback
- Show loading states for async operations
- Provide clear success/error messages
- Use appropriate icons in notifications (`ico` parameter)
- Validate user input before processing

### Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Include appropriate ARIA labels where needed
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Maintain focus management in modals

## Data Persistence

### Storage
- Use `PluginAPI.getStorage()` and `setStorage()` for persistence
- Store saved reports with unique IDs (timestamps)
- Handle storage errors gracefully
- Provide clear feedback on save/load operations

### Data Format
- Store reports as JSON objects with metadata (name, date, content)
- Include timestamp for sorting and identification
- Validate data structure when loading
- Handle migration of old data formats if needed

## Common Patterns

### Modal Operations
- Show modal: set `modal.style.display = 'flex'`
- Hide modal: set `modal.style.display = 'none'`
- Always populate content before showing modal
- Clear content when closing modal

### Clipboard Operations
- Use `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` for copying
- Handle permissions and errors gracefully
- Show success notification after copy
- Provide fallback for older browsers if needed

## Dependencies

### Production
- No external runtime dependencies (vanilla JavaScript)
- Relies on Super Productivity's PluginAPI

### Development
- Vitest for testing
- JSDOM for DOM testing
- Coverage reporting with v8

### Adding Dependencies
- Minimize external dependencies
- Only add dependencies if absolutely necessary
- Consider bundle size and security implications
- Document why the dependency is needed

## Documentation

### README
- Keep README.md up to date with feature changes
- Include clear installation instructions
- Provide usage examples with screenshots where helpful
- Document new features in the Features section

### Code Documentation
- Document complex algorithms with comments
- Keep manifest.json.template metadata accurate
- Update version numbers consistently across files

## Security Considerations

- Never store sensitive data in plugin code
- Validate all user input
- Sanitize data before rendering to prevent XSS
- Handle API errors without exposing internal details

## Best Practices

1. **Minimal Changes**: Make the smallest possible changes to achieve goals
2. **Test First**: Run existing tests before making changes
3. **Iterative Testing**: Test changes frequently during development
4. **Follow Patterns**: Match existing code patterns and style
5. **Error Handling**: Always handle errors gracefully with user feedback
6. **Performance**: Keep the plugin responsive and efficient
7. **Compatibility**: Ensure changes work with Super Productivity API
8. **Documentation**: Update docs for user-facing changes
